title: "My Calorie Mate"
order: 4
---

This project was produced during a 24hr hackathon as part of my bootcamp at BrainStation. The learning objective was to solidify our understanding of Web APIs and DOM manipulation methods, implementing both in a project with some consideration to UX design and purposeful functionality. That makes this one of the few projects out there NOT using a JavaScript framework!

The site uses a natural language search API provided by [Nutritionix](https://www.nutritionix.com/), which returns an estimated calorie impact of either food consumed or exercise undertaken. This allows the app to calculate a users total calorie consumption and usage thoughout a day with the ambition of enabling them to maintain a caloire defecit in the aim of weight loss. The app also uses the localstorage API to persist session data across visits.

Unfortunately the Nutritionix API costs are too high beyond one user for me to consider leaving it deployed. I still use it sometimes myself though to keep track of my weight loss agenda. The code can be found in it's [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/James-Bosley/api-hackathon).
