Another BrainStation project, possibly based on a well known video streaming service. This was also our first (almost) full stack application. A proper SPA on the front end, utilizing React with dynamic client side routing and fully responsive design. On the back end is a Node/Express server following a MVC pattern. The data store for this one was in a Json file, which is why this one is only 'nearly' a full stack application.

The site allows users to search for uploaded video content and comments made by users, who can also increment the likes and views. The video controls have also been created from scratch and use the video element API on the DOM.
The second page is a mocked upload page, although this does not facilitate the actual video upload, the thumbnail image is fully customisable along with the title and description.

Unfortunately due to contractual obligations with BrainStation, I am unable to share my source code, or publicly deploy the application. If you happen to be a current student, however, you may find the [next project](/projects/helpful-resources#link-info) in this list beneficial, or if you just want to [cheat](/all-the-answers#link-info#cheat).
