A genuine full stack application, my first, and another BrainStation group project. The main learning objective of this was the management of the development through Jira. We determined a logical workflow, assigned story-points and allocated jobs using the system.

The site tracks store inventory across multiple locations and gives the user the ability to perform CRUD operations using the GUI to both locations and their related inventory.

This project was also the first to use a SQL database as a data store. Addionally, since project completion, I have migrated the back end to use Bookshelf.js ORM. I would recommend this to no-one. On the surface it would appear that the library is no longer maintained, and I found it difficult to use. I have since used [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/#link-info), which has much better documentation and a more logical workflow.

Credit to [Lidija](https://github.com/lcelik#link-info) and [Thomas](https://github.com/TD142#link-info) who were my collaborators on the project.

Unfortuately due to contractual obligations with BrainStation, I am unable to share my source code, or publicly deploy the application. If you happen to be a current student however, and you just want to [cheat](/all-the-answers#link-info#cheat).
