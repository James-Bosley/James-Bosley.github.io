This was an early project I concieved to practice consuming third pary APIs, and given the news at the time when I was learning, a Covid statistics application was a natural choice. It makes use of an API provided publicly by the UK Government, and can be used to narrow down case, death and vaccination rates on a national basis, on a country basis and on an UTLA (upper tier local authority) basis. You can still visit [Covid Query](https://covid-query.surge.sh#link-info).

Many of the advertised data points are no longer captured and published on a daily basis, but it is still a useful tool for historical research, and most national-level statisics are still updated daily.

Have a look at the source code in it's [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/James-Bosley/noughts-and-crosses#link-info).
