More practice using APIs. This application is part of Codecademy's front end developer pathway and represents the first site I made that incorporates user authentication, this time by implementing an OAuth 2 implicit grant flow with Spotify's API. This site allows a user to sign into their Spotify account, search for songs either by track name or artist name and save them to a playlist that will persist in their account.

Whilst this application is no longer deployed, you can still see the code in it's [repo](https://github.com/James-Bosley/jammming#link-info). It used what you could call old fashioned React class components, also using a now out of date practice of binding component methods to the instance.
