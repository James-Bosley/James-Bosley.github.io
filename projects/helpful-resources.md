order: 6

This was a project convcieved duing our second hackathon at BrainStation. This was a group project where the main learning aim was to develop our Git workflow skills, ensuring that we could work together making a purposeful application without breaking it by overwriting each other changes.

The site collates a large quantity of resources that were useful to us during our learning journey, with the intended purpose of making it easier for all students to look back and find information they need at a glance.

Due to Heroku's recent announcement about the termination of free projects, this site is no longer hosted, but you can still view the source code, and therefore access the linked resources in the repos for the [client](https://github.com/James-Bosley/helpful-resources#link-info) and the [server](https://github.com/James-Bosley/helpful-resources-api#link-info).
