title: "Helpful Resources"
order: 4
---

This was a project conceived during our second hackathon at BrainStation. This was a group project where the main learning aim was to develop our Git workflow skills, ensuring that we could work together to make a purposeful application whilst successfully integrating our code with the rest team during the work period.

The site collates a large number of useful resources we used during our learning journey, with the purpose of making it easier for students to look back and find the information they need at a glance.

Due to Heroku's recent announcement about the termination of free projects, this site is no longer hosted, but you can still view the source code, and therefore access the linked resources in the repos for the [client](https://github.com/James-Bosley/helpful-resources#link-info) and the [server](https://github.com/James-Bosley/helpful-resources-api#link-info).
