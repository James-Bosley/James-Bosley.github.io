title: "Noughts and Crosses"
order: 1
---

My very first project. You will notice that it isn't even a web project. My first exposure to coding was when I took a free course with Cisco Networking Academy, a programme sponsored by the UK Government to introduce people to career paths in technology. Whilst it wasn't the path I ended up taking, by the end of it I was hooked on what could be achieved by code and convinced me of the fact that there is place for me in the tech industry.

Being little more than a simple script, with some frankly unnecessary embellishments, this project is not deployed. But if you want to see it in action, grab the code from it's [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/James-Bosley/noughts-and-crosses#link-info) and either run it locally if you have Python installed or paste the code into an online sandbox editor such as this one by [OpenEDG](https://edube.org/sandbox#link-info).
